Some important notes about the evaluation.


- Regarding the first subtask (named entity recognition):
    Only the SET of named entities is evaluated. Repeated named entities
    are not taken into account. (A repeated named entity has the same
    text, span, and type.)


- Regarding the second subtask (normalization):
    They only compare (evaluate) the SET of identifiers. Not the whole
    list of identifiers.


- Regarding the third subtask (indexing identifiers):
    Repeated MeSH_Indexing_Chemical annotations do not have an impact.
    Only the SET is evaluated.
